<p>Our research integrates cutting-edge experimental, computational, and theoretical approaches to dissect the molecular origins of cell-to-cell heterogeneity and its implications for human diseases. Our lab officially opens on 01.08.2023 and is located at the <a href="https://www.izi.uni-stuttgart.de/">Institute of Cell Biology and Immunology</a> of the <a href="https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/">University of Stuttgart</a>. Our research is supported by the <a href="https://www.tenuretrack.de/en/the-tenure-track-programme">Tenure-Track program</a> of the Federal Ministry of Education and Research and the State of Baden-W&uuml;rttemberg. </p>

<p>We aim at building an interdisciplinary team consisting of biologists, chemists, physicists, mathematicians, and engineers. If you are interested in our research and believe that science is exciting, please <a href="/join">check out</a> our latest open positions!</p>
