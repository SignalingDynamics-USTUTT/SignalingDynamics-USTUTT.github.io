      <strong>Self-Introduction</strong>
      <p>I have taken a highly interdisciplinary career path. Initially trained as a theoretical chemist, I entered the world of biology in my graduate studies and learned how to build mathematical models to explain the relationship between molecular noises and heterogeneous cell phenotypes. Feeling that I lacked sufficient understanding of biological mechanisms, I then joined an experimental lab as a postdoc, spending half of my time building computational infrastructure for the lab and the other half performing wet lab experiments on my own. Together, I have received rigorous training in most aspects of systems biology. All of my work consists of significant experimental and computational aspects, and they are all published in internationally reputable journals, such as Nature Communications, Cell Reports, eLife, and Nucleic Acids Research. As a Junior Professor, I will combine my interdisciplinary expertise to unravel why cancer therapies could fail. Outside of the lab, I enjoy lying on the bed and playing computer games (quite boring... I admit).</p>
