Depending on your interest, the projects can be purely computational, purely experimental, or a mixture of both. If you are enrolled at the University of Stuttgart and are interested in joining us, please contact <a href="mailto:chengzhe.tian@izi.uni-stuttgart.de">Jun-Prof. Chengzhe Tian</a>. 

<h4>No Suitable Positions?</h4>
<p>We are always looking for excellent candidates.

We are always happy to support applications for independent fellowships.</p>

<p>Note. In order to enroll as a Ph.D. student in our faculty, you must hold a M.Sc. or M.Eng. degree (or equivalent). If you only hold other degrees, such as a medicine degree, your application will be rejected by our faculty. Postdoc applicants are not subject to this rule. </p>
